## MinecraftStatistics 3
###### A plugin to track player statistics, MinecraftStatistics 3 is a fork of MinecraftStatistics by Zander van der Meer intended for the Miner's Glory community.
***
For a online web view of the statistics of our players I searched for a simple plugin that just sync the most basic details of every online player to the database. Too bad I was unable to find one so I created this myself. It is really small and it only syncs the player data to the database on a frequency you can edit in the config.yml. And it changes the is_online flag on join/leave.

##### In a nutshell
- Syncs all basic player stats to the database on a frequency you can set
- Only 10kb!
- Uses only 1 table, and 1 row per player
- Data can be used everywhere
-is_online flag is updated on player join and quit
-Check below for all tracked stats

##### Commands
- /statsync => Syncs statistics of all player that are currently online to the database. Use permission `minecraftstatistics.sync` to limit access to this command

##### Installation
- Download the jar file and drop it into your plugins folder
- Start the server and close it.
- Edit your MySQL details in the config.yml file.
- (optional) change the frequency of the update task
- Start your server again, and check your table. A new row will be added if it doesn't exist for a player.

##### Questions? Ideas?
If you have any questions or ideas for this plugin, don't hesitate to share it. I'm more than happy to open source this plugin or add it myself. (This plugin will become open source if people like it)
